    <p>You need to put ; at the end of each coded line there are exceptions though</p>
    <p>
      he general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers)
      are: Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
      Names must begin with a letter Names should start with a lowercase letter
      and it cannot contain whitespace Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we
      will not use it in this tutorial) Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and
      "myvar" are different variables) Reserved words (like Java keywords, such
      as int or boolean) cannot be used as name
    </p>
    <p>
      remember to put f at end of float variables oh and double variable must
      hve the value end with a d
    </p>
    <p>
      Use float or double? The precision of a floating point value indicates how
      many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of
      float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a
      precision of about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use double for most
      calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      all the last part is saying is that double hasmore area for decimal points
    </p>
    <p>you can put e in it for scientific notation aswell</p>
    <p>
      boolean only does true or false and char only stores a single character
    </p>
    <p>
      char a = 65, b = 66, c = 67; System.out.println(a); System.out.println(b);
      System.out.println(c); that would just show A B C in the horizontal
      direction because it has more than one char
    </p>

    <p>The String data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes:</p>
    <p>Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.</p>
<p>The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

    Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
    Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
    A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
    A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
    The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.</p>
    <p>when changing variable it changes it everwhere not just the code that comes after it</p>
    <p>int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
        int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
        int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
      i find it intresting that you can do that but hey im here to learn</p>
      <p>arithmetic operators

        +	Addition	Adds together two values	x + y	
          -	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
          *	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y	
          /	Division	Divides one value by another	x / y	
          %	Modulus	Returns the division remainder	x % y	
          ++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
          --	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x</p>
          <p>= is called a asighnment operator its what i thought i think its the same as another coding language i cant remember</p>
          <p>The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable</p>
          <p>comparison operators
            ==	Equal to	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y
          </p>
          <p>Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:</p>
          <p>all logical operators
            && 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
          </p>
          <p>A String in Java is actually an object, which contain methods that can perform certain operations on strings. For example, the length of a string can be found with the length() method:</p>
          <p>There are many string methods available, for example toUpperCase() and toLowerCase():</p>
<p>You can use the concat() method to concatenate two strings</p>
<p>If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string concatenation</p>
<p>If you add two strings, the result will be a string concatenation</p>
<p>https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_string.asp more string references and rules if i need to know more later</p>
<p>The Math.max(x,y) method can be used to find the highest value of two or more numbers</p>
<p>java break and continue can be used in loops</p>
<p>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
  Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
  Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
  Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</p>
  <p>if cannot be capital or it wil cause error lowercase only</p>
<p>When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop</p>
<p>There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array</p>
